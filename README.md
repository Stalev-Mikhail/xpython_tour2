 
# Multi-Task Python Project

This project consists of two individual tasks implemented in separate Python scripts: `task1.py` and `task2.py`. 

## Task 1: Interactive Story with temp input

### Description
`task1.py` is an interactive text-based story where the user plays a character who asks their mom for permission to go outside. Depending on the temperature provided by the user, the story progresses in different directions with various endings.

### Features
- Delayed text output for a more immersive experience.
- Multiple story branches based on user input regarding the temperature and decision-making moments.
- Different endings based on the decisions made by the user.

### How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `task1.py` is located.
5. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
Usage Instructions
Follow the prompts to enter the temperature when asked.
Make decisions by inputting 1 or 2 to influence the story's outcome.
Task 2: Maze Solver
Description
task2.py is a graphical maze solver using the Pygame library. The user provides the start and end coordinates within a predefined maze, and the program visualizes the path from the start point to the end point.

Features
Ability to input starting and target coordinates.
Visualization of the maze and the path taken by the solver.
Interactive window displaying the steps taken to solve the maze.
Prerequisites
To run task2.py, ensure you have the following installed:

Python
Pygame library (You can install it via pip)
 
pip install pygame
How to Run
Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
Download or clone this repository.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where task2.py is located.
Run the script using the command:
 
python task2.py
Usage Instructions
Enter the starting coordinates when prompted (x and y).
Enter the target coordinates (x and y).
Observe the maze-solving process in the Pygame window.
